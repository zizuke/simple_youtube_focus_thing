I didn't like the fact that it's so hard to focus on what you're doing with the option to procrastonate on YT. So I made this quick and easy thing to help anyone that was in my position. 

Open the .html file with a text editor.

Enter the **video ID** after /embed/ like so:

https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIV2KchSyGQ 

oIV2KchSyGQ = ID

![alt text](https://github.com/zizuke/simple_youtube_focus_thing/blob/master/a.jpg?raw=true)

https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZIpFytCSVc 

in this part:
```
<iframe height="100%" width="100%" class="myIframe"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIV2KchSyGQ">
</iframe>
```

After that, save, exit, and just double-click the .html file to open.

You also have the option to autoplay and more. Just check out this link: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_youtube.asp
Just make sure to only modify the URL.
