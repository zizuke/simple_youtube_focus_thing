I didn't like the fact that it's so hard to focus on what you're doing with the option to procrastonate on YT. So I made this quick and easy thing to help anyone that was in my position. 

All you have to do is enter the **video ID** after /embed/ like so:

https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIV2KchSyGQ 

oIV2KchSyGQ = ID

in

```
<iframe height="100%" width="100%" class="myIframe"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIV2KchSyGQ">
</iframe>
```

You also have the option to autoplay and more. Just check out this link: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_youtube.asp

Just make sure to only modify the URL.
